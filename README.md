## Models


snowflake-arctic-embed is a suite of text embedding models that focuses on creating high-quality retrieval models optimized for performance.


The `snowflake-arctic-embedding` models achieve **state-of-the-art performance on the MTEB/BEIR leaderboard** for each of their size variants. Evaluation is performed using these [scripts](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake-arctic-embed/tree/main/src). As shown below, each class of model size achieves SOTA retrieval accuracy compared to other top models.


The models are trained by leveraging existing open-source text representation models, such as bert-base-uncased, and are trained in a multi-stage pipeline to optimize their retrieval performance. First, the models are trained with large batches of query-document pairs where negatives are derived in-batchâ€”pretraining leverages about 400m samples of a mix of public datasets and proprietary web search data. Following pretraining models are further optimized with long training on a smaller dataset (about 1m samples) of triplets of query, positive document, and negative document derived from hard harmful mining. Mining of the negatives and data curation is crucial to retrieval accuracy. A detailed technical report will be available shortly.

### [snowflake-arctic-embed-xs](https://huggingface.co/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-xs)


This tiny model packs quite the punch. Based on the [all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) model with only 22m parameters and 384 dimensions, this model should meet even the strictest latency/TCO budgets. Despite its size, its retrieval accuracy is closer to that of models with 100m paramers.

## Usage


### Using Sentence Transformers

You can use the sentence-transformers package to use an snowflake-arctic-embed model. Here we show how to use our latest model, `snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5`.

```python
import torch
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
from torch.nn.functional import normalize

# Model constant.
MODEL_ID = "Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5"

# Your queries and docs.
queries = ['what is snowflake?', 'Where can I get the best tacos?']
documents = ['The Data Cloud!', 'Mexico City of Course!']

# Load the model.
model = SentenceTransformer(
    MODEL_ID, model_kwargs=dict(add_pooling_layer=False),
)

# Generate text embeddings.
query_embeddings = model.encode(queries, prompt_name="query")
document_embeddings = model.encode(documents)

# Scores via dotproduct.
scores = query_embeddings @ document_embeddings.T

# Pretty-print the results.
for query, query_scores in zip(queries, scores):
    doc_score_pairs = list(zip(documents, query_scores))
    doc_score_pairs = sorted(doc_score_pairs, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    print(f'Query: "{query}"')
    for document, score in doc_score_pairs:
        print(f'Score: {score:.4f} | Document: "{document}"')
    print()

#### OUTPUT ####
# Query: "what is snowflake?"
# Score: 0.3521 | Document: "The Data Cloud!"
# Score: 0.2358 | Document: "Mexico City of Course!"

# Query: "Where can I get the best tacos?"
# Score: 0.3884 | Document: "Mexico City of Course!"
# Score: 0.2389 | Document: "The Data Cloud!"
#

#### Variation: Truncated Embeddings ####
query_embeddings_256 = normalize(torch.from_numpy(query_embeddings)[:, :256])
doument_embeddings_256 = normalize(torch.from_numpy(document_embeddings)[:, :256])
scores_256 = query_embeddings_256 @ doument_embeddings_256.T

# Pretty-print the results.
for query, query_scores in zip(queries, scores_256):
    doc_score_pairs = sorted(zip(documents, query_scores), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

### Using Huggingface transformers


You can use the transformers package to use an snowflake-arctic-embed model, too. Here we show how to use our latest model, `snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5`. For optimal retrieval quality, use the CLS token to embed each text portion and use the query prefix below (just on the query).


```python
import torch
from torch.nn.functional import normalize
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

# Model constants.
MODEL_ID = "Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m-v1.5"
QUERY_PREFIX = 'Represent this sentence for searching relevant passages: '

# Your queries and docs.
queries  = ['what is snowflake?', 'Where can I get the best tacos?']
documents = ['The Data Cloud!', 'Mexico City of Course!']

# Load the model and tokenizer.
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_ID)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(MODEL_ID, add_pooling_layer=False)
model.eval()

# Add query prefix and tokenize queries and docs.
queries_with_prefix = [f"{QUERY_PREFIX}{q}" for q in queries]
query_tokens = tokenizer(queries_with_prefix, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt', max_length=512)
document_tokens =  tokenizer(documents, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt', max_length=512)

# Use the model to generate text embeddings.
with torch.inference_mode():
    query_embeddings = model(**query_tokens)[0][:, 0]
    doument_embeddings = model(**document_tokens)[0][:, 0]

# Remember to normalize embeddings.
query_embeddings = normalize(query_embeddings)
doument_embeddings = normalize(doument_embeddings)

# Scores via dotproduct.
scores = query_embeddings @ document_embeddings.T

# Pretty-print the results.
for query, query_scores in zip(queries, scores):
    doc_score_pairs = list(zip(documents, query_scores))
    doc_score_pairs = sorted(doc_score_pairs, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    print(f'Query: "{query}"')
    for document, score in doc_score_pairs:
        print(f'Score: {score:.4f} | Document: "{document}"')
    print()

#### OUTPUT ####
# Query: "what is snowflake?"
# Score: 0.3521 | Document: "The Data Cloud!"
# Score: 0.2358 | Document: "Mexico City of Course!"

# Query: "Where can I get the best tacos?"
# Score: 0.3884 | Document: "Mexico City of Course!"
# Score: 0.2389 | Document: "The Data Cloud!"
#

#### Variation: Truncated Embeddings ####
query_embeddings_256 = normalize(query_embeddings[:, :256])
doument_embeddings_256 = normalize(doument_embeddings[:, :256])
scores_256 = query_embeddings_256 @ doument_embeddings_256.T

# Pretty-print the results.
for query, query_scores in zip(queries, scores_256):
    doc_score_pairs = sorted(zip(documents, query_scores), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    print(f'Query: "{query}"')
    for document, score in doc_score_pairs:
        print(f'Score: {score:.4f} | Document: "{document}"')
    print()

#### OUTPUT ####
# Query: "what is snowflake?"
# Score: 0.3852 | Document: "The Data Cloud!"
# Score: 0.2721 | Document: "Mexico City of Course!"

# Query: "Where can I get the best tacos?"
# Score: 0.4337 | Document: "Mexico City of Course!"
# Score: 0.2886 | Document: "The Data Cloud!"

### Usage Note: Long Context Embedding With `m-long`

If you use the long context model with more than 2048 tokens, ensure that you initialize the model like below instead. This will use [RoPE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09864) to allow up to 8192 tokens.


``` python
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    'Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m-long',
    trust_remote_code=True,
    safe_serialization=True,
    rotary_scaling_factor=2
)
```

### Using Transformers.js

If you haven't already, you can install the [Transformers.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js) JavaScript library from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xenova/transformers) by running:
```bash
npm i @xenova/transformers
```

You can then compute embeddings from arctic-embed models as follows (`m-long` variant shown):

```js
import { pipeline, dot } from '@xenova/transformers';

// Create feature extraction pipeline
const extractor = await pipeline('feature-extraction', 'Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m-long', {
    quantized: false, // Comment out this line to use the quantized version
});

// Generate sentence embeddings
const sentences = [
    'Represent this sentence for searching relevant passages: Where can I get the best tacos?',
    'The Data Cloud!',
    'Mexico City of Course!',
]
const output = await extractor(sentences, { normalize: true, pooling: 'cls' });

// Compute similarity scores
const [source_embeddings, ...document_embeddings ] = output.tolist();
const similarities = document_embeddings.map(x => dot(source_embeddings, x));
console.log(similarities); // [0.36740492125676116, 0.42407774292046635]
```
